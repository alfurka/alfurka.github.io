My Ph.D. thesis, titled `Essays on Administrative Data Methodologies,` delves into the utilization of administrative data in economics, addressing related statistical challenges. It introduces innovative techniques such as Double Score Matching for mass-imputation and the Local Resampler algorithm for synthetic data generation. In the subsequent chapters, I utilize linked administrative data to estimate household preferences for urban parks and examine the impact of colleagues on private health insurance demand. These empirical studies demonstrate the unique research opportunities enabled by linked administrative data. Beyond my thesis, my research interests revolve around theoretical and applied econometrics, with a special focus on health economics and housing market dynamics.
