## Published Work

- [Spatial analysis of Twitter sentiment and district-level housing prices](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/JERER-08-2018-0036/full/html), *Journal of European Real Estate Research*, (2019). **Abstract:** Studies have shown a correlation and predictive impact of sentiment on asset prices, including Twitter sentiment on markets and individual stocks. This paper aims to determine whether there exists such a correlation between Twitter sentiment and property prices.


## Working Paper

- [Double Robust Mass-Imputation with Matching Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09275), (2021). **Abstract:** This paper proposes using a method named Double Score Matching (DSM) to do mass-imputation and presents an application to make inferences with a nonprobability sample. DSM is a k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that uses two balance scores instead of covariates to reduce the dimension of the distance metric and thus to achieve a faster convergence rate. DSM mass-imputation and population inference are consistent if one of two balance score models is correctly specified. Simulation results show that the DSM performs better than recently developed double robust estimators when the data generating process has nonlinear confounders. The nonlinearity of the DGP is a major concern because it cannot be tested, and it leads to a violation of the assumptions required to achieve consistency. Even if the consistency of the DSM relies on the two modeling assumptions, it prevents bias from inflating under such cases because DSM is a semiparametric estimator. The confidence intervals are constructed using a wild bootstrapping approach. The proposed bootstrapping method generates valid confidence intervals as long as DSM is consistent.
