All my work revolves around computers. Many hours in front of the screen, reading and typing. Well, most of us nowadays work like that. However, in the last couple of months, I've been typing even more because I'm in the middle of completing my thesis. This isn't just writing; it's coding too. By May, I started feeling pain in my fingertips. I've felt this before, but it used to be after short intense typing periods. This time, it’s been consistent.

So, I thought about replacing my basic keyboard. When I looked around, there were so many options. You might have seen those weird-shaped ergonomic keyboards. I saw them, but I didn't want the hassle of learning to use a totally new kind of keyboard.

Then, I came across mechanical keyboards. It's incredible how passionate some people are about them. Gamers, office folks, writers – they’re all talking about it, especially on Reddit (r/MechanicalKeyboards). So, I thought, "Why not give it a shot?"

For those who aren’t familiar, mechanical keyboards use individual switches for each key, which often provide better tactile feedback than regular ones. Some advantages? They're durable, customizable, and the typing just feels... satisfying.

I went for the Keychron K3 V2. It's a slim model and it has these blue switches. If you’re wondering, blue switches give a tactile and audible click with every press. After using it for a few months, I wish I'd made the switch earlier. At first, I thought I was making more mistakes with it. But after testing, I realized I was typing 10-15 words per minute faster than with my old one. The accuracy? Pretty much the same. Maybe I felt I was making mistakes because I was typing quicker. Oh, and the pain in my fingertips? Gone, even after long hours of typing. But a word of caution: mechanical keyboards can be loud. If you're in an office, your neighbors might not appreciate the noise. Lucky for me, I have my own space.
