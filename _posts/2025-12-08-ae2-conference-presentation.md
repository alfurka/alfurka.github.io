I had the pleasure of presenting our paper **"Bridging Language Barriers: The Impact of Large Language Models on Academic Writing"** (co-authored with Burak Dalaman and [Nathan Kettlewell](https://sites.google.com/site/nrkettlewell/)) at the **Inaugural AE2 Conference** — the Australasian Econometric Conference of the Association of Econometricians (ANZAE).

The three-day event was hosted by the Department of Economics at Macquarie University Business School, held at the Macquarie University City Campus (Level 24, 123 Pitt Street, Sydney) from **8–10 December 2025**. The conference featured a one-day Summer School followed by two days of high-quality econometrics research presentations, fostering collaboration across academia and industry.

It was a great opportunity to share our findings on how LLMs are reshaping academic writing and to engage with fellow econometricians from across Australasia.
