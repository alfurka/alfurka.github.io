I presented a paper at the **International Health Economics Association (IHEA) Conference 2025** in Indonesia. This was a joint work with **Shan Jiang, Yuanyuan Gu, and Bonny Parkinson** from MUCHE, and forms part of Shanâ€™s PhD thesis.  

Our study focuses on **inequality in quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) in Australia**. We received valuable feedback that will help us refine the work further.  

The paper uses the **Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey** to conduct a series of innovative estimations and generate the **Australian baseline health distribution**. This methodological contribution aims to support **health technology assessment (HTA)**, particularly in **distributional cost-effectiveness analysis (DCEA)** for drug cost-effectiveness evaluation. 

We look forward to sharing our findings soon.
