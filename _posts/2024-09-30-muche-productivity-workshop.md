We recently launched the first productivity workshop series at MUCHE, starting with my presentation on how Jupyter Notebooks and AI can aid coding. I showcased how AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Codium can significantly boost efficiency, and highlighted the collaborative benefits of using notebooks for clearer and more organized coding.
