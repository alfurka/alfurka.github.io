I'm thrilled to announce that my paper **"Generating Synthetic Data with Locally Estimated Distributions for Disclosure Control"** has been officially published in the *Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics*!

**Kalay, A. F. (2025).** "Generating Synthetic Data With Locally Estimated Distributions for Disclosure Control." *Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics*, 1–24. [https://doi.org/10.1111/anzs.70032](https://doi.org/10.1111/anzs.70032)

This paper has been on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00884) since **October 2022**, but underwent major revisions thanks to thorough feedback from anonymous referees. The final version is significantly improved in both clarity and scope.

This publication marks the **first chapter of my PhD thesis** to appear in a journal. The work introduces a framework for generating synthetic data that balances data utility with disclosure risk, enabling data custodians to statistically control privacy when releasing sensitive datasets.
