I had the pleasure of presenting our research, 'Social Interactions in the Demand for Private Health Insurance...' (collaborative work with Alicia N. Rambaldi and Christiern Rose) at the Workshop on Economics of Health and Wellbeing. The feedback was invaluable, and I was particularly pleased to meet Randall P. Ellis from Boston University's Department of Economics.
