I recently had the privilege of presenting at the **Artificial Intelligence, Law and Society Conference** at Macquarie University on February 14, 2025. My presentation, *“Generating Synthetic Data with Locally Estimated Distributions for Disclosure Control,”* was part of my PhD thesis.

In this work, I conceptualized and developed a framework that parameterizes both data utility and disclosure risk, enabling data custodians of sensitive datasets to statistically control their privacy risks when creating synthetic data sets. A key innovation of this approach is its ability to handle outlier observations in real data, allowing users to adjust their risk levels as needed. Given that the approach is semi-parametric, it is not only computationally fast but also capable of accurately replicating even small datasets.

I'm excited to share that all of this work is now available as a Python package: **[synloc](https://github.com/alfurka/synloc)**.

I am extremely grateful for the invitation to present and for the insightful discussions that followed at the conference.
