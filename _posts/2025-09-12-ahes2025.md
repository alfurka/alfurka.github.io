I presented *The Impact of Antidepressant Initiation on Labour Market Productivity* at AHES 2025 in Canberra. This is another study using PLIDA, a joint work with `Jonas Fooken` and `Henry Cutler`. We received excellent feedback and are already exploring further results.

Our paper proposes a novel identification strategy that exploits the unique features of Australia’s linked administrative data (PLIDA). The main challenge in this study is that the reverse effect (income $\to$ depression) is stronger than the causal effect we’re trying to estimate. Thanks to PLIDA, we developed an innovative approach to circumvent this issue. The most striking finding is the pronounced gender heterogeneity in the effects. I’ll share the full set of results soon as we continue refining our analysis.

Here’s our MUCHE team between Australia’s Old and New Parliaments :)
