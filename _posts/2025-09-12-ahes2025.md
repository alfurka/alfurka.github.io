I presented **The Impact of Antidepressant Initiation on Labour Market Productivity** at **AHES 2025** in Canberra. This is a joint work with **Jonas Fooken** and **Henry Cutler** (MUCHE). We received great feedback and will explore further results. 

**Whatâ€™s new**
- A **novel identification strategy** that exploits the unique features of Australian **linked administrative data**.
- Strong **sex heterogeneity**: effects differ markedly for males and females.
- **Public release of findings** is coming soon.
