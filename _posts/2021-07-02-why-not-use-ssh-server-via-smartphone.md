I am running, checking, and revising simulations all the time. I often only connect, see results, revise, and resubmit the simulation. Takes 3 mins on average. However, I am not in front of my PC all the time. 

It occurred to me that I can simply connect ssh server Via my phone (android). It works smoothly. I picked the most popular app in the play market. It is free and working just fine: JuiceSSH. Check it out!
