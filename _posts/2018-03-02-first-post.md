Hello! 

My name is Ali Furkan. I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at the University of Queensland. My primary field is theoretical and applied econometrics. I have a particular interest in matching estimators, spatial models, and peer effects in network models.

I am also a chess enthusiast ([My Lichess account](https://lichess.org/@/alfurka/perf/rapid) and podcast publisher ([Cahil Hoca](https://cahilhoca.com/) - in Turkish). 

You can access my research/work and read my blog from alfurka.github.io. The blog contains short articles about econometrics (statistics/machine learning), software (Python & R programming and others), education (in Turkish), and my thoughts.
