A few weeks ago, a friend texted me with unexpected news: we had both received the **[Dean's Award for Outstanding HDR Thesis](https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/higher-degree-research/awards/deans-award-outstanding-hdr-theses)** from the School of Economics at the University of Queensland, back in 2024!

Neither of us had received any official notification about the award. Somehow, we were among the recipients but never informed. It was a pleasant surprise to discover this recognition immediately after 2025 ended. 

Well... Thanks, UQ! 🎉

**Thesis**: [Essays in Administrative Data Methodologies](https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:b48c90d)
